	<p>
		This project is created to be a boilerplate/framework for my web projects.
		My goal is to make it robust, easy to add functions and have a quick turnaround on all clientside code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Quick turnaround comes from being able to edit html, css and script and add such files without recompiling.
		I have planned to make it very clientside driven. All data access goes through ajax with a framework for controlling access rights.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also prepared with mongo database, websocket, a background daemon process and a testing framework.
